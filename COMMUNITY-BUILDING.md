I’ve should be out in nature but since I’m having car problems I’ve been thinking about this topic a little more. 

What lead up to this topic?

Some time ago I came across this book called A Canticle For Leibowitz which portrays Christian monasticism as a keeper of sorts of recorded history and knowledge in a post apocalyptic world. Interesting idea. 

I was just browsing random books but intrigued by the whole setting I found myself skimming through this book on the history of Christian monasticism, and in a way I really resonated with this man called Saint Pachomius the Great and his legacy, considered to be the patron saint of community building for his role in organizing the desert hermits who sought to emulate Jesus’ time in the wilderness into a productive social movement after (according to tradition) an angle appeared to him and said,

> **“Do not live alone like the hermits before you, but gather together the young monks and establish a community for them.”**

Partly because a desert hermitage is not for the weak. But to this end, Pachomius didn’t just gather the monks (many of whom weren’t necessarily young though many of the old monks didn’t see the point of the endeavor), he built and organized a monastic “company” from scratch, including a kind of economic model to sustain the mission. His approach was highly structured and innovative for its time, resembling what we might call an **early form of social entrepreneurship**.

The results of which functioned like a self sustaining institution that lasted for centuries with a legacy that lasted for well over a thousand years. 

Socially, his approach allowed younger monks to be trained, supported, and disciplined within a structured environment rather than struggling alone. While as organizations they played a considerable role in their local communities, both in the time Pachomius and for centuries afterwards. Engaging in such activities as simple charitable work to large scale agricultural developments that greatly improved the productivity of the peasants and even developing a sort of retirement system in an age when being old de facto meant that one was impoverished. 

More broadly, the monastic model inspired by Pachomius played a crucial role in preserving classical knowledge during the early medieval period, especially in monasteries that copied and safeguarded ancient manuscripts. These institutions later became the foundation of Europe’s educational system. 

Although in the end these institutions accumulated too much wealth while also becoming too much of a cool bro club so the protestants shut it down. 

Overall, one of my biggest takeaway is how simple community building can create economically thriving and socially meaningful systems in otherwise stagnant or regressive environments with no upward mobility, and this all began from the work and traditions laid down by the desert hermits.

# More Generally

Personally, I really resonated this form of communities as institutions. 

Nowadays, everyone talks about community building, but what do they mean? 

In my mind there are internet communities and there are geographically co-located communities. 

Personally I want more geographically co-located communities but here people really drag their feet as soon as they gotta put in a little effort in physically attending and engaging in such events. 

This is why, in my mind, communities are institutions, and all non governmental organizations need a business model. Just as much as the early monastic communities required a business model to sustain their community. 

Overall, geography co-located communities just seem objectively better. But how? 

I suppose there’s no solution for all geographically co-located communities. But perhaps someone can start something that shows the way for others in their own niches.  

---

A major problem with geopolitically co-located communities is that the pool of traits that matter are limited or nonexistent. 

This is where globally available communities shine. But only geographically colocated communities are most humane and personal. 

It’s quite a conundrum. 

Personally, my philosophy is to work with what one has. 

(Like the marines, personally I once considered joining the military and they actually got back to me when I reached out which was quite surprising because in hindsight I was super messed up in every possible aspect and so for that they’ll always have a place in my heart.) 

Pachomius’ background as a soldier is what made him think the way he did. Though for me I have no such background. (I do encourage my younger brothers to join the military.)  

Although I suppose Pachomius was drafted so it’s not like he was a willing participant but it gave him a mindset for proper community organization. 

**Concerning universities:**

Personally I absolutely cringe when universities talk about “leadership” and especially when actors talk of such things as “becoming the leader one knew they could be” without any regard for what such an individual actually brings to the table. 

It’s such an overrated term nowadays that I absolutely refuse to use such ego stimulating phrases.

All that matters is what talents one can bring to the table. 

After all, there’s no need to say one is a leader, as the saying goes “he who says he is a king is no true king”. People naturally prop up those who serve them. So therefore such phrases are absolute cringe to my ears. 

But I digress…

Personally I don’t resonate with those “communities” created by universities. 

Perhaps everything went wrong when the Protestants shut down the Anglo monastic institutions in favor of the more secular and rising university system. 

Those institutions they shut down facilitated lifelong communities and perhaps they would have evolved alongside universities but as something more than monastic societies, such as full fledged lifelong professional communities.

Nowadays,

I just don’t know if there’s any hope for a better system of lifelong, geopolitically colocated communities.

Maybe my focus should be simply getting rich by whatever means. So afterwards I’ll have money to throw around to experiment with alternative models that achieve my desired goals.

**Closing remarks,** 

I think it’s interesting that the guy who’s considered to be the patron Saint of community building converted to Christianity after experiencing simple humanity from the Christians (in his life as a roman soldier). Looking back on my own life, it seems like those few who showed any kindness with regard to me were themselves Christian, and after Pachomius’ own story I was like, I don’t know any which way but I may as well identify as Christian myself to honor their small acts of kindness. (Sorry Bertrand Russell.)

**PS** 

**I don’t agree with the official definition of social entrepreneurship.** If there’s no historical examples of such from history (and especially before the Industrial Revolution) then it’s a contrived idea. 

Although at the same time I suppose there’s a first for everything. Perhaps this is why I’ve been so fixated on this idea as inspired by Pachomius.

Although the situation for better local communities does seem hopeless because ultimately everyone would rather be like the desert hermits, all too content in their simple ways.

Maybe this is why I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the meaning of this idea that we all get what we tolerate in life. Perhaps if the situation is truly hopeless then the only thing that matters is picking the right hill to die on. After all there’s no predicting fate, fortune changes with the wind, and so you may as well pick a principle good or bad because there’s no guarantee any which way and furthermore the whole of life is just too complicated to be so conscious of everything. This is why I prefer to be less conscious in my consciousness to avoid the follies of bad life optimizing heuristics because ultimately the best of which may be those that aren’t so flimsy. It’s simulated of a sort. Simulated primacy perhaps by means of principle. (I’ll have more to say about my developing idea of simulated primacy elsewhere.) 

**PPS**

One topic I’ve been thinking about is that nowadays it’s not enough to be the best in local terms when the standard is globally defined and furthermore even when global significance is attained its ultimately not sustainable because there’s always a fresh generation of talent coming up the ranks (although nowadays younger generations aren’t known for being all that socially adept which diminishes sheer talent). Such that any organization based on local talent would struggle to compete with the global standard of such ruthless efficiency. But for me as a programmer, such is akin to low-level optimization details where higher level algorithmic efficiency is typically far more significant. In the case of sheer talent, those who are more organized and more efficiently organized will always outcompete those who are far less organized or organized in a far less efficient manner. 

But maybe such needn’t be the picture. 

After all some men are of the mindset: **“avoid success at all costs!”**

Imagine someone build a self sustaining community of zealots and only zealots can discern good talent when they see it because they see it in themselves. In this case, the best of the talent pool comes to them inspired by their higher ideals and during times of crisis they may even stay within the organization because they are zealots and in this manner these organizations may rise where the others vanish from history because as they say the edge of chaos is the realm of maximum adaptability—where only zealots can linger because they are zealots—and in this manner new opportunities may be found and perhaps to the extent that whole new ecological niches can be created. 

Ultimately, someone should organize the zealots because zealots are best in an organized community.
