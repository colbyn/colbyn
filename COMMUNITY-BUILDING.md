I’ve should be out in nature but since I’m having car problems I’ve been thinking about this topic a little more. 

What lead up to this topic?

Some time ago I came across this book called A Canticle For Leibowitz which portrays Christian monasticism as a keeper of sorts of recorded history and knowledge in a post apocalyptic world. Interesting idea. 

I was just browsing random books but intrigued by the whole setting I found myself skimming through this book on the history of Christian monasticism, and in a way I really resonated with this man called Saint Pachomius the Great and his legacy, considered to be the patron saint of community building for his role in organizing the desert hermits who sought to emulate Jesus’ time in the wilderness into a productive social movement after (according to tradition) an angle appeared to him and said,

“Do not live alone like the hermits before you, but gather together the young monks and establish a community for them.”

Partly because a desert hermitage is not for the weak. But to this end, Pachomius didn’t just gather the monks (many of whom weren’t necessarily young though many of the old monks didn’t see the point of the endeavor), he built and organized a monastic “company” from scratch, including a kind of economic model to sustain the mission. His approach was highly structured and innovative for its time, resembling what we might call an **early form of social entrepreneurship**.

The results of which functioned like a self sustaining institution that lasted for centuries with a legacy that lasted for well over a thousand years. 

Socially, his approach allowed younger monks to be trained, supported, and disciplined within a structured environment rather than struggling alone. While as organizations they played a considerable role in their local communities, both in the time Pachomius and for centuries afterwards. Engaging in such activities as simple charitable work to large scale agricultural developments that greatly improved the productivity of the peasants and even developing a sort of retirement system in an age when being old de facto meant that one was impoverished. 

More broadly, the monastic model inspired by Pachomius played a crucial role in preserving classical knowledge during the early medieval period, especially in monasteries that copied and safeguarded ancient manuscripts. These institutions later became the foundation of Europe’s educational system. 

Although in the end these institutions accumulated too much wealth while also becoming too much of a cool bro club so the protestants shut it down. 

Overall, one of my biggest takeaway is how simple community building can create economically thriving and socially meaningful systems in otherwise stagnant or regressive environments with no upward mobility, and this all began from the work and traditions laid down by the desert hermits.

# More Generally

Personally, I really resonated this form of communities as institutions. 

Nowadays, everyone talks about community building, but what do they mean? 

In my mind there are internet communities and there are geographically co-located communities. 

Personally I want more geographically co-located communities but here people really drag their feet as soon as they gotta put in a little effort in physically attending and engaging in such events. 

This is why, in my mind, communities are institutions, and all non governmental organizations need a business model. Just as much as the early monastic communities required a business model to sustain their community. 

Overall, geography co-located communities just seem objectively better. But how? 

I suppose there’s no solution for all geographically co-located communities. But perhaps someone can start something that shows the way for others in their own niches.

A major problem with geopolitically co-located communities is that the pool of traits that matter are limited or nonexistent. 

This is where globally available communities shine. But only geographically colocated communities are most humane and personal. 

It’s quite a conundrum. 

Personally, my philosophy is to work with what one has. 

(Like the marines, personally I once considered joining the military and they actually got back to me when I reached out which was quite surprising because in hindsight I was super messed up in every possible aspect and so for that they’ll always have a place in my heart.) 

Pachomius’ background as a soldier is what made him think the way he did. Though for me I have no such background. (I do encourage my younger brothers to join the military.)  

Although I suppose Pachomius was drafted so it’s not like he was a willing participant but it gave him a mindset for proper community organization. 

**Concerning universities:**

Personally I absolutely cringe when universities talk about “leadership” and especially when actors talk of such things as “becoming the leader one knew they could be” without any regard for what such an individual actually brings to the table. 

It’s such an overrated term nowadays that I absolutely refuse to use such ego stimulating phrases.

All that matters is what talents one can bring to the table. 

After all, there’s no need to say one is a leader, as the saying goes “he who says he is a king is no true king”. People naturally prop up those who serve them. So therefore such phrases are absolute cringe to my ears. 

But I digress…

Personally I don’t resonate with those “communities” created by universities. 

Perhaps everything went wrong when the Protestants shut down the Anglo monastic institutions in favor of the more secular and rising university system. 

Those institutions they shut down facilitated lifelong communities and perhaps they would have evolved alongside universities but as something more than monastic societies, such as full fledged lifelong professional communities.

Nowadays,

I just don’t know if there’s any hope for a better system of lifelong, geopolitically colocated communities.

Maybe my focus should be simply getting rich by whatever means. So afterwards I’ll have money to throw around to experiment with alternative models that achieve my desired goals.
