**2025-2-3:** I’ve hardly been productive lately… 

Overall, it’s probably time for me to take a break from computers and all online activities, to renew my energy and refresh my thoughts. 

While preparing for such, I’m looking for some topics to ponder. I'm considering historical examples of community building and perhaps social entrepreneurship. Which I thought I’d write some miscellaneous notes on based on what I’ve read in the past. Perhaps when I return I’ll write up something interesting based on the following.

Some time ago I came across this book called A Canticle For Leibowitz which portrays Christian monasticism as a keeper of sorts of recorded history and knowledge in a post apocalyptic world. Interesting idea. 

Later on when skimming through this book on the history of Christian monasticism I found myself fascinated with this figure called Saint Pachomius the Great and his legacy, considered to be the patron saint of community building for his role in organizing the desert hermits who sought to emulate Jesus’ time in the wilderness into a productive social movement after (according to tradition) an angle appeared to him and said,

“Do not live alone like the hermits before you, but gather together the young monks and establish a community for them.”

Partly because a desert hermitage is not for the weak. But to this end, Pachomius didn’t just gather the monks (many of whom weren’t necessarily young though many of the old monks didn’t see the point of the endeavor), he built and organized a monastic “company” from scratch, including a kind of economic model to sustain the mission. His approach was highly structured and innovative for its time, resembling what we might call an **early form of social entrepreneurship**.

The results of which functioned like a self sustaining institution that lasted for centuries with a legacy that lasted for well over a thousand years. 

Socially, his approach allowed younger monks to be trained, supported, and disciplined within a structured environment rather than struggling alone. While as organizations they played a considerable role in their local communities, both in the time Pachomius and for centuries afterwards. Engaging in such activities as simple charitable work to large scale agricultural developments that greatly improved the productivity of the peasants and even developing a sort of retirement system in an age when being old de facto meant that one was impoverished. 

More broadly, the monastic model inspired by Pachomius played a crucial role in preserving classical knowledge during the early medieval period, especially in monasteries that copied and safeguarded ancient manuscripts. These institutions later became the foundation of Europe’s educational system. 

Although in the end these institutions accumulated too much wealth while also becoming too much of a cool bro club so the protestants shut it down.

Overall, one of my biggest takeaway is how simple community building can create economically thriving and socially meaningful systems in otherwise stagnant or regressive environments with no upward mobility, and this all began from the work and traditions laid down by the desert hermits.
