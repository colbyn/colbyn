### Naming Conventions

**Regarding naming conventions:** because some people have problems with the ‘SS’ prefix, I’ve since decided that ‘DD’ is actually easier to type, but I’ve already grown accustomed to the ‘SS’ prefix for all publicly exposed top-level identifiers and furthermore many projects are based on this naming convention… So such may be what I’m stuck with but henceforth I’ll focus more on names of two words that begin with a ‘D’. (Personally as someone whose ancestors fought the axis powers including taking such a bride as the spoils of war I don’t think such is a big deal and typing efficiency is most pressing on my mind as a programmer. (On a tangent is it interesting that the only smart one in the family was from Europe.)) 

**As I see it:**
- `AA`: maybe
- `SS`: ideal
- `DD`: ideal
- `ZZ`: too hard to type
- `XX`: idk seems like Elong Musk’s personal namespace and I use ‘X’ for system type aliases
- `CC`: no used for C FFI stuff and kinda hard to type
- `FF`: maybe - kinda hard to type 
- `WW`: way too hard to type
- `QQ`: way too hard to type


### Changing Times

The times are changing throughout society. 

Even liberals seem to be moving away from the European style welfare mindset and I suspect if Europe’s elite got together and rebuilt their systems from a fresh slate they’d implement less with regard to welfare programs.

**Concerning Academia:**

I suspect that some may have copied my college aspirations but as I now see it, are there any easy pickings left in medical research in particular and scientific research in general?

Such that the future must necessarily be something new—from a new foundation. Which I analogously regard as something akin to the derivative free toolkit. What’s possible with the old toolkit has been maxed out and so the future must be based on a new toolkit whatever that may be.

Overall I’m not particularly concerned about cutting scientific research. I suspect that those stuck in this space will pivot to research with ‘AI’ buzzwords which will signal the end of fundamental scientific research.

## Clarifications

Apparently my notion of *discrete math* entails more than I had thought, notably topics I know nothing about. My introduction to such was from purely functional programming focused textbooks (i.e. what’s expressible in terms of a simple lambda calculus based model of computation) where this whole idea of numbers just weren’t a thing. I prefer a framework based on purely discrete symbols and structures and relations between such. Simple and easy (the way god intended if anything.)

## Random Note

As a software researcher, half the problem is choosing your constraints wisely. Ultimately, projects need hard constraints to succeed (and not just be another copycat.)

For instance i’ve been thinking about this problem. In a way I am serious about [redacted]. But how could this be done?

I don’t know why but I find this interesting. 

From historical precedence,

Haskell would not be what it is today without the hard and never before seen constraint of lazy evaluation. Just to emphasize the point, nowadays lazy evaluation is considered to be a design mistake, but it shaped all other aspects in such a way that made it was it is today and therefore it was a worthwhile design mistake. (Although nowadays I’d rather use PureScript if only tooling was better.)

More generally,

It is well known that harder problems yield more satisfactory results. 

From a software research perspective, projects need hard and technically challenging constraints to innovate and make something new. 

So,

Perhaps this could be the defining constraint that makes [redacted] what it is and not just another copycat. 

But,

Another problem of the software researcher concerns generality or specificity. For instance should ‘X’ be implemented ad-hoc or in a uniform manner? Typically greater uniformity is best and most elegant but requires more research to find the lowest common denominator approach. Although more practically, greater uniformity generally ensures support for things that don’t neatly fit into predefined categories.

Similarly concerning generality or specificity, is the question of parameterization or polymorphous systems. Such as a system that is agnostic to certain aspects that normally define such a system ad-hoc. How many systems out there can only work with a single implementation of something? Greater uniformly is generally most forward compatible as the landscape evolves and in turn as environmental perturbations change.

Likewise on a tangent, 

Greater uniformity facilitates greater diversity within a whole system, and after all in ecology is it well understood that diversity increases productivity and stability because species vary in their response to environmental fluctuations, ensuring that some will always maintain system function.

## Random Thought 

I whole heartedly believe that honesty is always best in any scenario, especially in politics. But here, politicians don’t understand that the solution space as represented below may entail a regression to arrive at a more optimal state.

No politician can change the nature of the system with better propaganda; if the people want change then the reality of going to point A to point B must be made clear to the public, such is the only sustainable way or otherwise the public will fee as though the movement is a scam and furthermore if course corrections are made while on the decline and before the inflection point then what results will be the worst of both worlds for the public at large, considerably so.

But reality is never so certain as the graph above, those on the left should pray that a solution is found by the other party, because what benefits may come of it are to their benefit as well (in numerous respects) while the risk of such endeavors is wholly assumed by the other side. It just makes sense. After all, clearly Americans care deeply about immigration and inflation and so if the right can figure this out then those on the left will be free to run on a more pure platform without concern for such issues.
