**Immigration:**

I’ve been thinking about immigration. I think governments should cease their top-down approach in favor of the self selection of the people (and maybe businesses.)

Nowadays, the right is very adverse to top down immigration policies, and the now the left is trying to figure out what to do when the cultural sentiment is such that Americans don’t want more top down immigration policies. 

I have an idea, historically cultural groups merged in terms of marriage, and nowadays guys are already going abroad doing just such. Immigration should be based on the self selection of the people (and maybe businesses) via such means and so bottom up immigration should be the favored streamlined approach.

In the case of bottom up selection from businesses perhaps it should be such that imported talent is more expensive by some multiple to discourage simply phasing out expensive talent in favor of cheaper alternatives. But easier said than done, there may be no option in this case that would satisfy both the interests of businesses and the general public. 

The people are just too sensitive to business over optimizing their labor force and especially in such a time as this.

**Sustainability:**

Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who cares about sustainability (given my current life perhaps) at a system level. 

Plants definitely care about sustainability in terms of energy consumption and productivity. In the case of photosynthesis they generally disregarded the most energetic wavelengths for better sustained energy utilization over time though it’s not entirely known why. 

Perhaps the reason why is just too foreign to our mindset of maximizing all things. As if from a plant’s perspective, maximizing energy flow just isn’t worthwhile in favor of sustained long term productivity.

**Social Cohesion:**

Nowadays I think everyone just wants some sense of stability in their lives, and stability through long term sustainability is the only way forward. 

Mass immigration does not contribute to the public’s desire for stability. 

Same for social cohesion, only through bottom up community building can people become more socially cohesive. Which was once the domain of religion and local churches but nowadays such just isn’t working for guys in particular. Most churches are too familiar oriented, and most guys nowadays aren’t gonna be starting families anytime soon (nor do they want anything to do with it, societal karma perhaps) and so something new must come forward.

For guys in particular, someone must come forward, channeling the Pachomius in terms of community building, and such a person will go down in history as a great man. Perhaps never before in history has there been such a market opportunity to active such greatness—unadulterated by the desires of our time, pure greatness persists through history.

Such a ‘one’ **must be found**, such a one **must come forward**, and just as in Pachomius’s time, such a one **should not be discouraged by the opinions of old men** who are all too content with the old ways that are objectively failing men.

**For non-western countries:**

The romans has no culture of their own and so they imported one and made it great. The romans expanded greek culture far beyond their original borders and beyond time itself. 

Don’t chase success as defined by the west, innovate elsewhere on a model that can be adopted by the west and such will become the standard for the next millennia.

Last night I had a trip unlike anything I’ve hitherto experienced.

**Consider,**

LLMs should make it plainly obvious that optimal convergence matters. 

**Therefore,**

What happens if the human population itself sub-optimally converges (with regard to our very nature at the information encoding level)? 

**Off the top of my head,**

From historical precedent we suspect from the agricultural revolution that genetic diversity plummeted but environmental perturbations were local and so the human species persisted. 

We also know from historical precedent that populations can utterly collapse, upwards of 90% as suspected when pathogens were transmitted from the old world to the new world, and now we find ourselves in an environment of ever decreasing genetic diversity, ever increasing informational similarity with regard to our very nature, and already we’re not that dissimilar in informational terms. So it may not take much to tip the scales. 

**So in summary,**

Thanks to the agricultural revolution now accelerated by the industrial revolution and then from the effects of ever increasing globalization, we find ourselves increasingly vulnerable to environmental threats, and to cope with such threats we find ourselves increasingly similar in informational terms at the level of our very nature and therefore the risk of suboptimal convergence as if a model of our species with respect to the solution space as it concerns changing environmental threats is all but guaranteed.

**So in the grand scheme of things,**

The future is doomed if genetic diversity is insufficient. In an increasingly fluctuating world, suboptional convergence means suboptional convergence. 

**How I would love to further look into this but LibGen is down!!!** 

(Also there should be a good quote from Dune concerning one of Paul’s trips.)

**PS:**

I swear i’ve read about this as it concerns derivative free optimization heuristics. Just as in a *mere* computer model, so too will be our inevitable demise! 

**PPS**

While I’ll probably be dead by then, karma will one day apply to society at large. As I wrote in my journal, 

> I suppose if no cultural solution is found then the simple biological imperative to breed will become more and more pronounced over the generations (although we’re currently seeing the opposite but regardless), in this manner the human race will inevitably bounce back but such will take time and at the cost of genetic diversity among the population (a factor that itself takes far more time to proliferate), the cost of which will be suboptimal convergence with regard to other desirable outcomes, like the fundamental survival of the species in such an ever fluctuating environment, in the grand scheme of things. 

All from the sins of the people including myself.

Regardless, I think I’ve taken enough drugs in my life, perhaps such a trip is what I’ve been waiting for to signal a time for change with regard to myself. But I suppose only time will tell. That was just way too intense.

### Naming Conventions

**Regarding naming conventions:** because some people have problems with the ‘SS’ prefix, I’ve since decided that ‘DD’ is actually easier to type, but I’ve already grown accustomed to the ‘SS’ prefix for all publicly exposed top-level identifiers and furthermore many projects are based on this naming convention… So such may be what I’m stuck with but henceforth I’ll focus more on names of two words that begin with a ‘D’. (Personally as someone whose ancestors fought the axis powers including taking such a bride as the spoils of war I don’t think such is a big deal and typing efficiency is most pressing on my mind as a programmer. (On a tangent is it interesting that the only smart one in the family was from Europe.)) 

**As I see it:**
- `AA`: maybe
- `SS`: ideal
- `DD`: ideal
- `ZZ`: too hard to type
- `XX`: idk seems like Elong Musk’s personal namespace and I use ‘X’ for system type aliases
- `CC`: no used for C FFI stuff and kinda hard to type
- `FF`: maybe - kinda hard to type 
- `WW`: way too hard to type
- `QQ`: way too hard to type


### Changing Times

The times are changing throughout society. 

Even liberals seem to be moving away from the European style welfare mindset and I suspect if Europe’s elite got together and rebuilt their systems from a fresh slate they’d implement less with regard to welfare programs.

**Concerning Academia:**

I suspect that some may have copied my college aspirations but as I now see it, are there any easy pickings left in medical research in particular and scientific research in general?

Such that the future must necessarily be something new—from a new foundation. Which I analogously regard as something akin to the derivative free toolkit. What’s possible with the old toolkit has been maxed out and so the future must be based on a new toolkit whatever that may be.

Overall I’m not particularly concerned about cutting scientific research. I suspect that those stuck in this space will pivot to research with ‘AI’ buzzwords which will signal the end of fundamental scientific research.

## Clarifications

Apparently my notion of *discrete math* entails more than I had thought, notably topics I know nothing about. My introduction to such was from purely functional programming focused textbooks (i.e. what’s expressible in terms of a simple lambda calculus based model of computation) where this whole idea of numbers just weren’t a thing. I prefer a framework based on purely discrete symbols and structures and relations between such. Simple and easy (the way god intended if anything.)

## Random Note

As a software researcher, half the problem is choosing your constraints wisely. Ultimately, projects need hard constraints to succeed (and not just be another copycat.)

For instance i’ve been thinking about this problem. In a way I am serious about [redacted]. But how could this be done?

I don’t know why but I find this interesting. 

From historical precedence,

Haskell would not be what it is today without the hard and never before seen constraint of lazy evaluation. Just to emphasize the point, nowadays lazy evaluation is considered to be a design mistake, but it shaped all other aspects in such a way that made it was it is today and therefore it was a worthwhile design mistake. (Although nowadays I’d rather use PureScript if only tooling was better.)

More generally,

It is well known that harder problems yield more satisfactory results. 

From a software research perspective, projects need hard and technically challenging constraints to innovate and make something new. 

So,

Perhaps this could be the defining constraint that makes [redacted] what it is and not just another copycat. 

But,

Another problem of the software researcher concerns generality or specificity. For instance should ‘X’ be implemented ad-hoc or in a uniform manner? Typically greater uniformity is best and most elegant but requires more research to find the lowest common denominator approach. Although more practically, greater uniformity generally ensures support for things that don’t neatly fit into predefined categories.

Similarly concerning generality or specificity, is the question of parameterization or polymorphous systems. Such as a system that is agnostic to certain aspects that normally define such a system ad-hoc. How many systems out there can only work with a single implementation of something? Greater uniformly is generally most forward compatible as the landscape evolves and in turn as environmental perturbations change.

Likewise on a tangent, 

Greater uniformity facilitates greater diversity within a whole system, and after all in ecology is it well understood that diversity increases productivity and stability because species vary in their response to environmental fluctuations, ensuring that some will always maintain system function.

## Random Thought 

I whole heartedly believe that honesty is always best in any scenario, especially in politics. But here, politicians don’t understand that the solution space as represented below may entail a regression to arrive at a more optimal state.

![function-graph](images/function-graph.jpg)

No politician can change the nature of the system with better propaganda; if the people want change then the reality of going to point A to point B must be made clear to the public, such is the only sustainable way or otherwise the public will fee as though the movement is a scam and furthermore if course corrections are made while on the decline and before the inflection point then what results will be the worst of both worlds for the public at large, considerably so.

But reality is never so certain as the graph above, those on the left should pray that a solution is found by the other party, because what benefits may come of it are to their benefit as well (in numerous respects) while the risk of such endeavors is wholly assumed by the other side. It just makes sense. After all, clearly Americans care deeply about immigration and inflation and so if the right can figure this out then those on the left will be free to run on a more pure platform without concern for such issues.
