# About Me

I’m an independent software researcher & writer who explores new ways of doing things, while generally trying to find the best way of doing something, guided by some ineffable sense of elegance.

As a software researcher, while every idea must begin somewhere, I understand very well the **limits of forethought**. 

For instance consider the field of computability theory, it is well known that there are hard limits on what one can ‘know’ upfront from static information. Especially in the context of formal verification, where given some Turing complete program description, there are many insights one may wish to know that are generally impossible to answer upfront without some degree of evaluation. But while this is in the context of automation and its limits, such problems are **equally relevant to the limits of forethought** because ultimately the human brain is itself a computer and so is itself bound by the limits of computation.

> Nowadays while some programmers are trying to put all other programmers outta a job, some mathematicians have been trying to put all other mathematicians outta a job for at least a century.

This is the value I bring to the table, and is why my research style is very ‘evaluative’ and in an ‘exploratory’ manner. If you’re looking for those game-changer insights that cannot be known upfront (such as those concerning a business model), then I will come in and *compute* the problem to completion, and then report back on what has been uncovered along with any speculative advisory foresights from a refined context.

Also, as every Haskell zealot knows all too well when it comes to research: **avoid success at all costs!** Or in other words don't chase success. (Although this remark may also just be cope in the Haskell community.)

**Note:** **with regard to source code ownership rights, such can be negotiated.**

> I usually standardize on rust because it’s the lowest common denominator solution in a multitude of respects, for instance I can compile (and even cross-compile depending on my dependencies) rust code for a multitude of platforms, along with great community support for a multitude of use cases. In general, rust isn’t perfect but it **just works** in numerous respects (especially for data modeling and serialization which is often overlooked). Unless there’s a strong justification elsewhere, such as if I’m doing native iOS/macOS UI work for which idiomatic Swift is preferred throughout unless there’s a strong justification for rust with regard to app logic functionality (such as to support cross-platform app logic or if I just need to plug into some rust crate.)

**Regarding my past research:**

I can’t do everything but what I can do I do well.

So far the highlight of my research (in order of coolness) has probably been:
1. Publishing hand drawn notes as self contained webpages in a resolution independent manner (why this is particularly cool is because it’s a fully freeform environment as webpages, also the editor includes some brilliant ideas for—among other things—dark mode support that no other note taking app does for some reason).
2. My brute force image compression optimizer (long story)
3. My native (iOS/macOS)  markdown renderer that supports all GitHub Flavored Markdown block types with full text-selection support (with multi-cursor support) in terms of TextKit 2 APIs which overall is probably one of the more practical components I’ve worked on (every single iOS app with a chatbot feature needs this).
4. I also once made an indentation based shell scripting language with some much needed improvements that all unix systems need (although this is probably the least loved of all my projects for some reason.) 
5. Regarding more abstract problems in computer science, I’ve designed and implemented a very nifty monadic parser combinator library in Swift. The monadic design here is just so elegant because it propagates the parser state between function calls without having to explicitly pass such around. Which just works so simply, and for that I think it’s beautiful. 

> Also someone needs to make a markdown based spreadsheet app using my native markdown rendering engine because such just seems superior to preexisting options in literally every conceivable manner possible including in terms of a native UI that just “feels right” and iOS users in particular (gotta love them ❤️) have been know to be super picky when it comes to text functionality (just ask the Flutter team.)
>
> Contact me if you need someone to figure out how to freakin implement horizontally scrollable text layout fragments which I’d love to solve once and for all. 

**In general:**

As a programmer who doesn’t use LLMs I don’t subscribe to any chatbot because everything I do is just too custom. Nowadays we forget that automation only applies to the most common of use cases, which for me is usually within the free tier. 

---

Honestly as a high octane thinker if I had kids I wouldn’t even want them to use LLMs unless I wanted to raise those with mentally inert mindsets that can only think in terms of corporate speak. 

If anything I’d love to explore anti-AI themed startup opportunities one day because it’d just be super ironic if such succeeded where all those success chasing startups failed.

# Secret Ongoing Essays

**In general these are not yet reading for public consumption.**

- [The far-future of AI]( https://gist.github.com/colbyn/6aeeeecd1b321db179c7253c6437b356 ): discusses a future for AI that itself evolves with the progression of time.
  
  This is a short rough draft that contains many points, all of which I’d like to enumerate on in a series of articles sometime in the future.

  **IMO this is a true model for a ‘brain’ that will be the interface between humans and all digital/analog information as it changes with the progression of time.** A true model for an assistant will be perpetually active, integrating the diverse array of signals from your data sources, into summary information available at your request, or actively engaging with you when conditions merit your attention.

  Some of my thoughts thereto are inspired by the book Time-Space, Spiking Neural Networks and Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence.
  > “Everything exists and evolves within time–space and time–space is within everything, from a molecule to the universe. Understanding the complex relationship between time and space has been one of the biggest scientific challenges of all time.”

  Which may be an understatement, this may be the greatest scientific challenge of all time and it’s developed will happen not be via the scientific method but through the ancient engineering method (that built Europe’s cathedrals at a time when the ‘why’ wasn’t understood) and so therefore a new generation of creative individuals are needed, trained to think in terms of problem solving heuristics. 

  Just as in computability theory we know there exist problems that are unsolvable, and for such problems we put on our creative hat and think in terms of imperfect heuristics that can at least work in narrow spaces, and through such a manner overcome problems that are otherwise mathematically impossible to solve.

Last night I had a trip unlike anything I’ve hitherto experienced.

**Consider,**

LLMs should make it plainly obvious that optimal convergence matters. 

**Therefore,**

What happens if the human population itself sub-optimally converges (with regard to our very nature at the information encoding level)? 

**Off the top of my head,**

From historical precedent we suspect from the agricultural revolution that genetic diversity plummeted but environmental perturbations were local and so the human species persisted. 

We also know from historical precedent that populations can utterly collapse, upwards of 90% as suspected when pathogens were transmitted from the old world to the new world, and now we find ourselves in an environment of ever decreasing genetic diversity, ever increasing informational similarity with regard to our very nature, and already we’re not that dissimilar in informational terms. So it may not take much to tip the scales. 

**So in summary,**

Thanks to the agricultural revolution now accelerated by the industrial revolution and then from the effects of ever increasing globalization, we find ourselves increasingly vulnerable to environmental threats, and to cope with such threats we find ourselves increasingly similar in informational terms at the level of our very nature and therefore the risk of suboptimal convergence as if a model of our species with respect to the solution space as it concerns changing environmental threats is all but guaranteed.

**So in the grand scheme of things,**

The future is doomed if genetic diversity is insufficient. In an increasingly fluctuating world, suboptional convergence means suboptional convergence. 

**How I would love to further look into this but LibGen is down!!!** 

(Also there should be a good quote from Dune concerning one of Paul’s trips.)

**PS:**

I swear i’ve read about this as it concerns derivative free optimization heuristics. Just as in a *mere* computer model, so too will be our inevitable demise! 

**PPS**

While I’ll probably be dead by then, karma will one day apply to society at large. As I wrote in my journal, 

> I suppose if no cultural solution is found then the simple biological imperative to breed will become more and more pronounced over the generations (although we’re currently seeing the opposite but regardless), in this manner the human race will inevitably bounce back but such will take time and at the cost of genetic diversity among the population (a factor that itself takes far more time to proliferate), the cost of which will be suboptimal convergence with regard to other desirable outcomes, like the fundamental survival of the species in such an ever fluctuating environment, in the grand scheme of things. 

All from the sins of the people including myself.

Regardless, I think I’ve taken enough drugs in my life, perhaps such a trip is what I’ve been waiting for to signal a time for change with regard to myself. But I suppose only time will tell. That was just way too intense.

### Naming Conventions

**Regarding naming conventions:** because some people have problems with the ‘SS’ prefix, I’ve since decided that ‘DD’ is actually easier to type, but I’ve already grown accustomed to the ‘SS’ prefix for all publicly exposed top-level identifiers and furthermore many projects are based on this naming convention… So such may be what I’m stuck with but henceforth I’ll focus more on names of two words that begin with a ‘D’. (Personally as someone whose ancestors fought the axis powers including taking such a bride as the spoils of war I don’t think such is a big deal and typing efficiency is most pressing on my mind as a programmer. (On a tangent is it interesting that the only smart one in the family was from Europe.)) 

**As I see it:**
- `AA`: maybe
- `SS`: ideal
- `DD`: ideal
- `ZZ`: too hard to type
- `XX`: idk seems like Elong Musk’s personal namespace and I use ‘X’ for system type aliases
- `CC`: no used for C FFI stuff and kinda hard to type
- `FF`: maybe - kinda hard to type 
- `WW`: way too hard to type
- `QQ`: way too hard to type


### Changing Times

The times are changing throughout society. 

Even liberals seem to be moving away from the European style welfare mindset and I suspect if Europe’s elite got together and rebuilt their systems from a fresh slate they’d implement less with regard to welfare programs.

**Concerning Academia:**

I suspect that some may have copied my college aspirations but as I now see it, are there any easy pickings left in medical research in particular and scientific research in general? 

Such that the future must necessarily be something new—from a new foundation. Which I analogously regard as something akin to the derivative free toolkit. What’s possible with the old toolkit has been maxed out and so the future must be based on a new toolkit whatever that may be.

Overall I’m not particularly concerned about cutting scientific research. I suspect that those stuck in this space will pivot to research with ‘AI’ buzzwords which will signal the end of fundamental scientific research.
