# About Me

I’m in an independent software researcher & writer who explores new ways of doing things (for a price of course), while generally trying to find the best way of doing something, guided by some ineffable sense of elegance. 

**Regarding my research:**

I can’t do everything but what I can do I do well.

So far the highlight of my research (in order of coolness) has probably been:
1. Publishing hand drawn notes as self contained webpages in a resolution independent manner (why this is particularly cool is because it’s a fully freeform environment as webpages, also the editor includes some brilliant ideas for—among other things—dark mode support that no other note taking app does for some reason).
2. My brute force image compression optimizer (long story)
3. My native (iOS/macOS)  markdown renderer that supports all GitHub Flavored Markdown block types with full text-selection support (with multi-cursor support) in terms of TextKit 2 APIs which overall is probably one of the more practical components I’ve worked on (every single iOS app with a chatbot feature needs this).
4. I also once made an indentation based shell scripting language with some much needed improvements that all unix systems need (although this is probably the least loved of all my projects for some reason.) 
5. Regarding more abstract problems in computer science, I’ve designed and implemented a very nifty monadic parser combinator library in Swift. The monadic design here is just so elegant because it propagates the parser state between function calls without having to explicitly pass such around. Which just works so simply, and for that I think it’s beautiful. 

> Also someone needs to make a markdown based spreadsheet app using my native markdown rendering engine because such just seems superior to preexisting options in literally every conceivable manner possible including in terms of a native UI that just “feels right” and iOS users in particular (gotta love them ❤️) have been know to be super picky when it comes to text functionality (just ask the Flutter team.)

> Contact me if you need someone to figure out how to freakin implement horizontally scrollable text layout fragments which I’d love to solve once and for all. 


**In general:**

As a programmer who doesn’t use LLMs I don’t subscribe to any chatbot because everything I do is just too custom. Nowadays we forget that automation only applies to the most common of use cases, which for me is usually within the free tier. 

---

Honestly as a high octane thinker if I had kids I wouldn’t even want them to use LLMs unless I wanted to raise those with mentally inert mindsets that can only think in terms of corporate speak. 

If anything I’d love to explore anti-AI themed startup opportunities one day because it’d just be super ironic if such succeeded where all those success chasing startups failed.

- **[COMMUNITY-BUILDING.md]( COMMUNITY-BUILDING.md ):** random notes on something... I sometimes wonder if the *next big thing* as they say will turn out to be some form of social entrepreneurship… I’ve been looking for historical examples of primitive social entrepreneurship. The notes thereto is one such example.

# Miscellaneous

Apparently my notion of *discrete math* entails more than I had thought, notably topics I know nothing about. My introduction to such was from purely functional programming focused textbooks (i.e. what’s expressible in terms of a simple lambda calculus based model of computation) where this whole idea of numbers just weren’t a thing. I prefer a framework based on purely discrete symbols and structures and relations between such. Simple and easy.
