# About Me

I’m in an independent software researcher & writer who explores new ways of doing things (for a price of course), while generally trying to find the best way of doing something, guided by some ineffable sense of elegance. 

As a programmer who doesn’t use LLMs I don’t subscribe to any chatbot because everything I do is just too custom. Nowadays we forget that automation only applies to the most common of use cases, which for me is usually within the free tier.

- **[STATUS-LOG.md]( STATUS-LOG.md ):** my general timeline of activities.
- **[VERY-PERSONAL-BIO.md]( STATUS-LOG.md ):** A more personal pre-2025 biographical status timeline (incomplete).
- **[COMMUNITY-BUILDING.md]( COMMUNITY-BUILDING.md ):** random notes on something... I sometimes wonder if the *next big thing* as they say will turn out to be some form of social entrepreneurship… I’ve been looking for historical examples of primitive social entrepreneurship. The notes thereto is one such example.
