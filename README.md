# Random Thought Of The Day 

The Greeks gave us two great ideas,

Cosmos: that everything, all existence and worldly phenomena is such that the human mind can learn to understand through reason.

Chaos: that everything is such that we cannot understand it, there’s no structure, rhyme or reason to all of existence.

Now, as far as what’s true, it’s hard to know, but in terms of outcomes the former concept of the cosmos has been very productive throughout human history and for our modern civilization in particular.

Moreover, personally I just feel as though it’s just more productive to believe in that which leads to more productive outcomes. We may as well presume that everything is fundamentally structured in such a way that the human mind can learn to understand all observed phenomena.

This gets me thinking, to understand, do we not begin with reducing observations to more abstract terms, and then building abstractions into more systematic descriptions, a model?

Everything beings with modeling.

Understanding this well will be a particular focus moving forward because there has to be more to know.
