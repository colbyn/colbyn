# About Me

I’m an independent software researcher & writer who explores new ways of doing things, while generally trying to find the best way of doing something, guided by some ineffable sense of elegance.

**Why does the world need software researchers?**

Because fundamentally, 

Ideas are cheap; nowadays methodology matters more than ever. For all the low hanging fruit is gone; the simplest opportunities have been taken. The startup space itself is liken to the first prospectors who got the gold nuggets lying in the riverbed; today the reality is such that you’ve got to dig deep or go home, and those who dig into the depths cannot use mere forethought, for what lies beneath cannot be seen by the mind’s eye. 

Just as the early oil prospectors didn’t have precise maps—just intuition and test drills. They had to drill, analyze the pressure, and adjust. The best oil fields weren’t found by foresight alone, but by adaptive exploration.

Just as neural networks themselves are iteratively refined, from a randomly provisioned series of numbers, data scientists apply a methodology in such a manner that the system converges towards some desired outcome, the result of which cannot be perceived upfront from static foresight. 

The rise the LLMs like ChatGPT should make it plainly obvious that static foresight has its limits. 

In times such as ours, methodology is now more important than ever; success is found only through iterative refinement, not static foresight. 

So,

* Choose methodology over static foresight.
* Choose methodology over static business models. 
* Choose methodology for uncovering ideas from the very depths where forethought cannot apply. 

This is where the researcher archetype comes into play. 

As every researcher is essentially uncovering ideas from the depths where forethought cannot apply. Such individuals are naturally curious, organized, and detail oriented. But most of all, such individuals are adept at gathering ideas, taking a hunch, and then digging into the depths—*via adaptive exploration*—where static foresight cannot apply. 

Personally, software research should be applied for developing software that just “feels right”. As a passionate SubStack writer, how I wish things were better! 

More generally, there’s so much software in everyday use that just doesn’t “feel right”. Pure and simple, and if these companies don’t innovate by uncovering ideas from the very depths, they will inevitably be superseded by those who do, because **the world needs good software!**

But while good software improves the lives and productivity of the people. The best software creates whole new ecological roles and niches. (Although personally I just want the software I use to “feel right”.)

---

Also, as every good researcher knows, don’t chase success, chase a good methodology, and as every Haskell zealot knows all too well when it comes to research: **avoid success at all costs!** 

Because success is easy, and that which is easy has its costs. For those of us guided by a higher standard, we want something more than mere success as defined by societal expectations. In this regard, the best of us are those zealots who’ve fried all their pain receptors and so the nervous system perceives nothing but this ineffable higher standard. 

Moving forward, I have a hunch that success has doomed the west. As I focus on building better communities, how I would love to plant roots someplace else. Perhaps where labor is cheaper. Over here billion dollar companies can’t even make native mobile apps, personally I blame the tech bro culture that arose alongside web clients. Ease of software and content delivery is most important, as shown by SubStack that basically popularized email based content distribution, but App Clips are a thing and a step in the right direction as far as even easier delivery mechanisms are concerned and yet tech bros are utterly incognizant of better ideas beyond web clients.

Over here tech bros are just too hella stimulated to take heed of anything outside their preconceived framework. For a mind that cannot change, they say stability breeds instability, especially as environmental perturbations change.

**Regarding my past research:**

I can’t do everything but what I can do I do well.

So far the highlight of my research (in order of coolness) has probably been:
1. Publishing hand drawn notes as self contained webpages in a resolution independent manner (why this is particularly cool is because it’s a fully freeform environment as webpages, also the editor includes some brilliant ideas for—among other things—dark mode support that no other note taking app does for some reason).
2. My brute force image compression optimizer (long story)
3. My native (iOS/macOS)  markdown renderer that supports all GitHub Flavored Markdown block types with full text-selection support (with multi-cursor support) in terms of TextKit 2 APIs which overall is probably one of the more practical components I’ve worked on (every single iOS app with a chatbot feature needs this).
4. I also once made an indentation based shell scripting language with some much needed improvements that all unix systems need (although this is probably the least loved of all my projects for some reason.) 
5. Regarding more abstract problems in computer science, I’ve designed and implemented a very nifty monadic parser combinator library in Swift. The monadic design here is just so elegant because it propagates the parser state between function calls without having to explicitly pass such around. Which just works so simply, and for that I think it’s beautiful. 

> Also someone needs to make a markdown based spreadsheet app using my native markdown rendering engine because such just seems superior to preexisting options in literally every conceivable manner possible including in terms of a native UI that just “feels right” and iOS users in particular (gotta love them ❤️) have been know to be super picky when it comes to text functionality (just ask the Flutter team.)
>
> Contact me if you need someone to figure out how to freakin implement horizontally scrollable text layout fragments which I’d love to solve once and for all. 

**In general:**

As a programmer who doesn’t use LLMs I don’t subscribe to any chatbot because everything I do is just too custom. Nowadays we forget that automation only applies to the most common of use cases, which for me is usually within the free tier. 

> Honestly as a high octane thinker if I had kids I wouldn’t even want them to use LLMs unless I wanted to raise those with mentally inert mindsets that can only think in terms of corporate speak. 
> 
> If anything I’d love to explore anti-AI themed startup opportunities one day because it’d just be super ironic if such succeeded where all those success chasing startups failed.

# Secret Ongoing Essays

**In general these are not yet reading for public consumption.**

- [The far-future of AI]( https://gist.github.com/colbyn/6aeeeecd1b321db179c7253c6437b356 ): discusses a future for AI that itself evolves with the progression of time.
  
  This is a short rough draft that contains many points, all of which I’d like to enumerate on in a series of articles sometime in the future.

  **IMO this is a true model for a ‘brain’ that will be the interface between humans and all digital/analog information as it changes with the progression of time.** A true model for an assistant will be perpetually active, integrating the diverse array of signals from your data sources, into summary information available at your request, or actively engaging with you when conditions merit your attention.

  Some of my thoughts thereto are inspired by the book Time-Space, Spiking Neural Networks and Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence.
  > “Everything exists and evolves within time–space and time–space is within everything, from a molecule to the universe. Understanding the complex relationship between time and space has been one of the biggest scientific challenges of all time.”

  Which may be an understatement, this may be the greatest scientific challenge of all time and it’s developed will happen not be via the scientific method but through the ancient engineering method (that built Europe’s cathedrals at a time when the ‘why’ wasn’t understood) and so therefore a new generation of creative individuals are needed, trained to think in terms of problem solving heuristics. 

  Just as in computability theory we know there exist problems that are unsolvable, and for such problems we put on our creative hat and think in terms of imperfect heuristics that can at least work in narrow spaces, and through such a manner overcome problems that are otherwise mathematically impossible to solve.
