A topic that has fascinated me since I discovered it is spiking neural networks (SNNs), a more biologically plausible form of AI. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). While I didn’t understand 99% of it, the textbook, Time-Space, Spiking Neural Networks and Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, had some interesting remarks. 

E.g.

> “Everything exists and evolves within time–space and time–space is within everything, from a molecule to the universe. Understanding the complex relationship between time and space has been one of the biggest scientific challenges of all time.”

In the first chapter the author wrote,

> ‘Time is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as “The indefinite continued progress of existence, events, etc., in past, present and future regarded as a whole”… When processes are evolving, their models need to be evolving too, i.e. to trace the dynamics of the processes and to adapt to changes in these processes over time.’

The author went on,

> “It would not be an overstatement to say that everything in nature evolves in time-space. But what are the rules, the laws that drive these processes, and how these rules change over time, how do they evolve? If we knew these rules, we could create computational models that can evolve in a similar manner as the real evolving processes, and use these models to make predictions and to better munderstand the processes. But if we do not know these rules, we can still try to uncover them from the data collected from these processes using machine learning. This was not possible during the time of Aristotle (4 century BC), but it is possible now as it is demonstrated in the book.”
