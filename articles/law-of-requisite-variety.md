# The Law of Requisite Variety

> Only variety can absorb variety.

Resilience and adaptability come from having enough complexity inside to match the complexity outside.

Basically, if the system’s internal options are too limited compared to the challenges it faces, it can’t adapt and will start to fail.

It’s from the field of cybernetics and is otherwise known as Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety.

**TL;DR**

Systems cannot cope with external complexity without a sufficient level of internal complexity.
