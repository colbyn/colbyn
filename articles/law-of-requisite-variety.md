# The Law of Requisite Variety

> **"Only variety can absorb variety."**

## Meaning

In any system that aims to maintain stability and adaptability in the face of disturbances, the controller (or regulating mechanism) must have at least as much variety in its responses as the environment has in its disturbances.

**Variety** here means the number of possible states or responses. If a system is faced with unpredictable or diverse conditions, it must be capable of equally diverse responses to cope effectively.

## Notes

Resilience and adaptability come from having enough complexity inside to match the complexity outside.

Basically, if the system’s internal options are too limited compared to the challenges it faces, it can’t adapt and will start to fail.

It’s from the field of cybernetics and is otherwise known as Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety.

## Points

* **Resilience**: A resilient system can absorb shocks without collapsing, which means it needs sufficient internal complexity (variety) to deal with external changes.

* **Adaptability**: A system’s ability to evolve or change its internal structure in response to new conditions also depends on having enough variety in its components and possible behaviors.

**TL;DR** Systems cannot cope with external complexity without a sufficient level of internal complexity.
