There’s this story in Taoist literature. Here, i'm using the translation as written in a book called The Perennial Philosophy.

“A drunken man who falls out of a cart, though he may suffer, does not die. His bones are the same as other people’s; but he meets his accident in a different way. His spirit is in a condition of security. He is not conscious of riding in the cart; neither is he conscious of falling out of it. Ideas of life, death, fear and the like cannot penetrate his breast; and so he does not suffer from contact with objective existence.”

Sometimes when reality hits too hard an inebriated person can survive certain situations where a sober person may not. As we see in modern times with drunk drivers who are later prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter though they themselves emerged from the accident unscathed.

For me the moral of the story hits home but in a different way. I used to get very emotional at the woes of life and usually instead of rolling with the punches I was always compelled to do something even if that something was very counterproductive. 

I learned firsthand, whatever has happened to you, you yourself can do far more harm to yourself than the original cause. In contrast the virtuous man is he who does not react to life’s woes and so does not suffer further adversity. Therefore we should all strive to be less conscious of life’s problems as the drunkard exemplifies. 

I once came across this passage,

“Each sin begetteth a special spiritual suffering. A suffering of this kind is like unto that of hell, for the more you suffer, the worse you become. This happeneth to sinners; the more they suffer through their sins, the more wicked they become; and they fall continually more and more into their sins in order to get free from their suffering.” —The Following of Christ

I’m all too familiar with the downward spiraling nature of sin. In contrast the virtuous man is he who does not suffer from contact with objective existence and so the original story concludes in the The Perennial Philosophy, “If such security is to be got from wine, how much more is it to be got from God?”
