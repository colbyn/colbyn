I bought my younger brother an illustrated version of the Zhuangzi for Christmas. I’ve been trying to get him to read more.

Personally, while it’s not the most profound thing in the whole book, for me this is the best parable therein:

I just find it interesting how in modern times you can have a head on collision with multiple fatalities and yet the inebriated driver usually walks away unscathed. While in mundane life simply reacting to life’s woes can significantly cascade bad luck. 

Similarly in The Following of Christ, Thomas à Kempis wrote, 

> “Each sin begetteth a special spiritual suffering. A suffering of this kind is like unto that of hell, for the more you suffer, the worse you become. This happeneth to sinners; the more they suffer through their sins, the more wicked they become; and they fall continually more and more into their sins in order to get free from their suffering.”

Likewise in the Tao Te Ching there’s a saying,
> “Only those who do not cling to their life can save it.”

Perhaps one day you’ll suddenly find yourself moments before a head on collision with a drunk driver on the highway. In that moment will you yourself cling to life—or will you submit to fate and follow the way? (i.e. the Dao)
